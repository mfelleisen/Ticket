### Library Files 

functionality that should probably exist in Racket's libraries	 	    

| file | purpose |
|--------------------- | ------- |
| [image.rkt](image.rkt) | fine color? (or/c string? symbol?)) | 
| [xsend.rkt](xsend.rkt) | a library that protects calls from exceptions and overly slow clients |
